🎉 Just dropped MakeMeAdminCLI — a PowerShell CLI for temporary local admin elevation!

🔐 High-level how it works:

  • Standard user requests elevation directly from the CLI
  • A secure service validates the request
  • User is temporarily added to the local Administrators group
  • Access automatically expires and removes itself

No GUI. No ticket ping-pong. No permanent admin sprawl. 🛠️

Inspired by the original Make Me Admin project — bringing the same concept to a modern CLI-first workflow.
